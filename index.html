<h1 style="text-align:center;">Music and Sports Venue Accessibility</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
  <p>Welcome to <span style="font-weight:bold"> Accessibilty in Music
  and Sports Venues!</span> The purpose of this webpage is to help people with
  disabilities find music/sports venues that are accessible in Chicago, Illinois.
  Each page on this site will focus on one specific venue and give details on
  the accessibilty for that venue. In addition, I have included a page comparing
  accessibility services between the venues. I created this page so that everyone
  can enjoy the thirll of concerts and live sporting events. I also created
  this page so that the information was easily accessible for all. I wanted the
  information to be all in one place so that people did not have to visit
  multiple sites to find the information they were looking for.
  I hope you find this site helpful!
